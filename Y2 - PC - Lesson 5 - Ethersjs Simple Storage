`Installation & Setup`
- `Local development` : 
	- `Hardhat` : 
		- it's javascript based for compilation, deploy, test and debug EVM based SC
	- `EthersJS` 
		- JS base library for working with smart contracts, wich it's what powers *Hardhat* 

- `How to deploy a contract using JS`
	- we're going to use asynchronous functions with JS to deploy our contracts or in other things
		- this is because when we're deploying a contract, we'll need to wait until it finishes to deploy before we can start to use him to call the functions 
	- solidity is *synchronous* for the most part of the time
		- we can have *asynchronous* interactions in solidity when working with oracles as chainlink
	- `deploying` 
		- so we're going to go through the same steps that Remix did in the browser, so
			- first remix usued to *compile* our code before deploying the contract 
				- to compile the code, we're going to use a tool called *solc-js* 
					- `yarn add solc` in our terminal
